BS_PDE_Solver_Explicit.ipynb:
PDE solver from grad project using explicit FDM. The latest version was accidentally deleted. However, on inspection I believe the later versions merely include code for a smaller step size and therefore greater accuracy.

vwap_code_ass3.ipynb:
VWAP code is looking at the distribution of hourly trading volumes among Pfizer, Apple and JP Morgan. This was another assignment for Uni.

asian_monte_carlo.ipynb:
Asian Option Monte Carlo simulated stock price paths and prices for arithmetic and geometric asian options. Another assignment for Discrete time financial modelling at Uni.

BS_PDE_Solver_Crank_Nicolson.ipynb:
First attempt at a semi-implicit PDE solver. This is using the Crank-Nicolson method. At this stage the error is staying relatively constant. Derivative approximations are a forward time and the spatial derivatives are an average across the time domain.

STAT_2004 Project.Rmd: R code for a project completed for STAT2004 - Analytics for observational data. Looking at various statistical methods to 
predict average life expectancy of a country.
